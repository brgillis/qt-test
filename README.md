# QT-Test

This is a learning project where I learn to use QT by building a simple program which runs mock unit tests on
user-determined values.

This starts by following the Quick Start guide at https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/quickstart.html. After that is working
successfully, I'll modify it into a desired novel program.
